    This is useful because sprites are z-layered with occlusion according to their

    sprites from some component distributions will always be behind sprites from
    others.
    An alternate design would be to let the environment handle sprite ordering,
    but this design is preferable because the order can be controlled more finely.
    For example, this allows the user to specify one sprite (e.g. the agent's
    body) to always be in the foreground while all the others are randomly
    ordered.
